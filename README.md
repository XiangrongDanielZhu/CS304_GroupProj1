# CS304_GroupProj1
Automatic speech data capture and adaptive endpointing detection

This project aims to capture real-time speech data and store it into .wav file. The entire development process and visualizations are included in report.ipynb notebook. If you want to directly apply the algorithm, you can directly run "python record.py" in the terminal/powersheel for the original algorithm or "python record_db.py" for the optimized one. 

Different brunches represent different optimizations and algorithms we have applied. You can track through every optimization process we made through this github proj.
